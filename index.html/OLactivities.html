        <h2>Soccer</h2>

        <p>
        I have played soccer for as long as I can remember and it remains to be one of my favorite hobbies. 
        Recently, my team participated in the JPL (Junior Premier League), or NPL (National Premier League).
        We travelled to Salt Lake City, Utah; Mesa, Arizona; and South Dakota. We have won many tournaments such as
        the Park City Cup, Presidents Cup, Coyote Cup, as well as many league titles.

        <h2>Computer Science</h2>

        <p>
        I had an intrest in computer science for a while, but never really acted on it until Sophmore year
        when I took Game Developement and Computer Programming. I took to it naturally and did very well in both
        classes. My Junior year I am taking Web Developement and Robotics, and I also am doing very well in these.
        On my own I loving using Unity to make my own Video Games and ideas for future projects.

        <h2>Places Visited</h2>

        <p>
        I haven't traveled much outside of the country, but there are a few places I've been. Some other countries
        been two cruises to Mexico, as well as a humanitarian trip to Argentina, which has by far been my favorite.
        In Argentina, we built a home for mistreated children, as well as saw Iguazu Falls in Brazil and the Andes 
        Mountains. My family also goes to Bear Lake every summer. I went to D.C. and Baltimore with my Grandma and 
        California quite a few times. Disneyland and Universal Studios were also a part of that.
