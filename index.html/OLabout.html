        <p>
            My name is Owen Langeland. I was born in Mesa, Arizona then moved to Salt Lake City for five years
            before moving here to St. George, which is where I've lived since then. I love soccer and going to
            the gym. In my free time I like to play video games and hangout with friends. Right now I work at a
            car wash making good money and having I'm having a good time with it. I take honors and college classes
            as a junior at Crimson Cliffs High School. My dad works at Intermountain as the finance director and
            my mom is a secretary for a real estate company. I have two siblings, my sister is 19 and in college, 
            my brother is 13 in middle school.
