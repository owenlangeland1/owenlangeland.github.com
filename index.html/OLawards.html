        <p>I have taken many honors classes in high school so far and mostly maintain good grades. One of the
        reasons I haven't been able to perform well in class is due to my three concussions. I have had to 
        overcome these one after another and I still manage to at least pass my classes, even if it's not all
        perfect scores.</p>

        <p>I started taking violin lessons when I was around 7. I have played ever since in many competitions
        and other performances. A was awarded the highest score in every competition I did. I've learned many 
        pieces over the years such as Back, Vivaldi, and Pachelbel. Now I play violin without taking lessons,
        but I still find it quite enjoyable.</p>
